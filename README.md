Welcome to my SQL portfolio repository! I organize my SQL projects and queries here, showcasing my skills in data processing, manipulation, and analysis with SQL.

## About Me
I am an undergraduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science who aspires to be a data analyst with strong data skills. My passion in this field have led me to learn various data exploration techniques, and I would like to share my work here as proof of my proficiency and skills in using SQL to gain insight and understanding from data.

## SQL Projects

Here you can find my work on SQL projects and assignments:
1. [Datacamp - Associate Data Analyst Practical Exam](https://github.com/AkuwuTumapel/DataCamp-ADA-Practical-Exam.git): This project aims to clean, filter, and visualize data for a grocery store as a timed practical exam for my Associate Data Analyst certification at Datacamp. Here I was able to apply data cleaning techniques such as null value handling and data standardization.
2. [Datacamp - Analyzing & Formatting PostgreSQL Sales](https://github.com/AkuwuTumapel/DataCamp-Formatting-PostgreSQL-Sales-Data.git): A PostgreSQL project with the goal of analyzing the most popular products in each category of an international store. I applied data analysis skills such as grouping, ranking, and data imputation to gain insight from sales data.
