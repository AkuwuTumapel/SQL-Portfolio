<br><br>
Welcome to my SQL portfolio repository! I organize my SQL projects and queries here, showcasing my skills in data processing, manipulation, and analysis with SQL.

## About Me
I am an undergraduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science who aspires to be a data analyst with strong data skills. My passion in this field have led me to learn various data exploration techniques, and I would like to share my work here as proof of my proficiency and skills in using SQL to gain insight and understanding from data.

## SQL Projects

Here you can find my work on SQL projects and assignments:
1. [Datacamp - Associate Data Analyst Practical Exam](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/sathyasatoto): This project aims to clean, filter, and visualize data for a grocery store as a timed practical exam for my Associate Data Analyst certification at Datacamp. Here I was able to apply data cleaning techniques such as null value handling and data standardization.
